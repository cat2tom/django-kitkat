This is an application for entering and storing QA test data at the Alfred
Health Radiation Oncology centre.

Documentation generated by Sphinx can be found in build/html/index.html

The file dbsqlite3 contains data that has been put in to the database 
without which the application will not work.  These are definitions of 
machines, ion chambers etc and the test definitions for tests that have 
been defined so far.

A superuser account has been created:
